%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function decodes a trial label from the dataset built from the
% recorded neurons. Specifically, the function evaluates the performance of
% the decoder when you dissociate the  time windows from which you pick the
% training and testing data. This dataset may be built from a pseudo-population or
% from simultaneously recorded ensemble of neurons. This code generates
% results for Fig 2a, 2e, 4a, 4f, 6a, 6b, 6c, 6e, 6f and 6g. This 
% code is run a 1000 times to generate a distribution of performances. The 
% mean of this distribution of performance is plotted as a heatmap 
% in these figures.

% Inputs-

% dataset : Size - Nneurons x Ntrials x Nbins.
% This matrix contains the activity of all the neurons used in decoding
% during correct trials in relevant time bins. Ntrials is the maximum
% number of trials recorded by the neurons. If a neuron is recorded with
% less than Ntrials trials, then the rest of the values in the matrix till
% Ntrials is zero-padded. Nbins is the length of the time bins for which
% this decoding was performed. Therefore the 5th neuron's activity in the
% 6th trial during the 8th time bin is denoted by dataset(5,6,8)

% m : Size - Nneurons x 1
% Each element in this array is the mean activity across all trials during
% the baseline period (300ms prior to the target onset) of a neuron

% st: Size - Nneurons x 1
% Each element in this array is the standard deviation of the activity
% activity across all trials during the baseline period (300ms prior to the
% target onset) of a neuron

% session: Size - Nneurons x 2
% Each element in the first column refers to the session in which the
% neuron was recorded. Also, this value as the index of the trials variable
% fetches all the trials performed in the session where the said neuron was
% recorded.

% Trial_Label - 'target' or 'distractor'
% this string refers to the trial label to be decoded from the dataset.

% trials: Size - struct 1 x Nsession
% Nsession is the number of recorded sessions from which we pool neurons to
% form dataset. Nsession also equals the number of unique values in the
% first column of the sessions array.

% dataset_e,m_e,st_e,etrials are the same as dataset,m,st and trials
% repectively but for error trials.

% Test is a string that takes the value 'Correct' or 'Error' to denote if
% we are decoding correct or error trials. This string is useful in
% differentiating the decoding in Fig 2 and Fig 4 of Parthasarathy et al
% Note while decoding the target from data recorded during error trials,
% the decoder is trained using data fromcorrect trials and tested using data
% from error trials.
%
% Output -
% performance: Size - Nbinstrain x Nbinstest
% An element (x,y) in this array refers to the performance of the decoder when
% trained using data from the xbin and tested using data from ybin.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function builds a matrix of trial indices and labels to build the
% training set. Trials from every session are split into training and
% testing pool. Further, two uniform distributions of 7 target labels was
% built to define the training and testing set's trial label. The length of
% these uniform distribution is defined by the number of trials used to
% train and test the decoder. For example, if the first trial label in the training set
% is target location 1, the function picks one trial for each neuron in the
% training pool with the target presented at target 1. Similarly, this is
% repeated for all the trial labels in the training and testing set.
% Inputs -
% Trial_Label - string - 'target' or 'distractor'

% trial_labels (target or distractor)
% train_label_no - Nneurons x Ntraintrials - indices of trials with
% trial label specified by train_label for all Nneurons.
% test_label and test_label_no are similar to train_label and
% train_label_no respectively but the trials to build test_label_no are
% chosen from the testing pool. Usually the length of train_label is set to
