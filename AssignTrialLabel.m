function trial_label = AssignTrialLabel(trials,flag)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function identifies the stimulus label
% (target/distractor/target-distractor location/euclidean distance between
% target and distractor location in trials) for the trials under trials.

% Inputs
% trials - array of structs containing timing and stimulus information from correct/
% error / aborted trials. This information about stimulus identity is
% stored as row,column co-ordinates. This function parses the row,column co-ordinates to
% to produces a discrete label for each stimulus label. Please note that for aborted trials, the animal
% should be engaged in the trial until the stimulus (label for which is
% identified in the function) is presented in the trial. Usually when
% AssignTrialLabel is called in a script/function, trials structure passed
% to the function contains information about trials recorded in one
% session.
% flag -  decribes which stimulus label to identify
% information about
% flag ==1 Target
% flag == 2 Distractor
% flag ==3 Target-Distractor pair
% flag == 4 Distance between target and distractor.
%
% Output
% trial_label - array of the same length as trials. Each entry in this
% variable corresponds to the discrete stimulus label identified in this
% function.
