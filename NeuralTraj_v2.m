%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This code computes the projection of neural activity onto
% principal components generated from correct trials. Please note that even
% though the code can generate projections for correct and error trials, we
% only use the projections from correct trials for Fig 2 and use both from
% correct and error trials for Fig 4 of Parthasarathy et al. The principal components are always
% generated using data from correct trials. However, Fig 2 uses all 7
% locations while Fig 4 uses only 4 locations.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input -
% xc1 and xc2 are the time limits that denote the time period of the data
% that is used to build the prinicipal components  For ex: if
% the prinicipal components need to be defined by the Delay 1 space:
% xc1 = 800ms (300ms of target period +  first 500ms of Delay 1. 0
% always denotes target onset) and xc2 = 1300ms.

% dataset represents the activity of all the neurons in spike counts used to build this prinicipal component space
% (and hence the data projected onto this space) in xms bins across the
% length of the trial for all the recorded correct trials. This is a 3d matrix.Size of 1st dimension represents
% the number of neurons used to build this space. Size of the 2nd dimension represents
% the max number of trials performed while recording any neuron included in
% this matrix. For neurons with lesser trials than this maximum, the matrix is zero-padded. And the last dimension represents the number of time bins. Similarly, dataset_e represents the matrix for error trials
%
% session refers to a matrix that specifies the session during which the
% neuron in the dataset was recorded. For ex: If dataset contained activity
% from 256 neurons. size of session is 256 x 2, where the first column
% specifies the indentity of the neuron within each session and the second
% column specifies the session during which the neuron was recorded.

% trials - size of this structure equals the number of sessions from which
% the neurons were used in this analysis. For every session, the structure
% contains timing information for the different task epochs and information
% about the presented target and distractor for all correct trials.
% etrials represents a similar structure for error trials

% count - number of neurons in dataset

% region - 'dlpfc' or 'fef'

% Nboot - number of bootstraps

% m/m_e - mean activity during baseline (before target presentation) for
% correct/error trials

% st/st_e - standard deviation of the activity during baseline (before
% target presentation) for correct/error trials

% Test is a string that takes the value 'Correct' or 'Error' to denote if
% we are generating the projections seen in Fig 3 (7 locations) or Fig 4 (4 locations).


% Output variables

% projected_data/projected_data_e - neural activity from correct/error
% trials spanning across the length of the trial from n neurons when
% projected onto all the principal components. 3d matrix - Ntrials x Ndimensions x Nbins

% label - Trial identity (target location/distractor location) of the data
% projected onto the principal components. Size - Ntrials x 1

% train and test the decoder. For example, if the first trial label in the training set
